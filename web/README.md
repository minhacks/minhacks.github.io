Headline: A short and clear statement about what you do. For example, "Custom Websites That Drive Results" or "Web Design Tailored to Your Brand."
Subheadline: A brief description of your unique selling proposition (USP). Example: "We create personalized, responsive websites that are as unique as your business." 2. Portfolio
This is the heart of your business. Show potential clients examples of websites you’ve created. Include screenshots, links to live sites, and even short case studies explaining the challenges and solutions you provided.
Include a variety of work: different industries, styles, and functionalities. This shows your versatility.
If you don't have much yet, you could create a couple of demo websites or offer discounted work in exchange for testimonials. 3. Services
Be clear about what you offer. For example:
Custom Website Design
E-commerce Solutions
Responsive Design (Mobile-Friendly)
Website Maintenance
SEO Optimization
Web Development (Front-end / Back-end)
Branding & UX/UI Design
For each service, briefly explain what it includes and why it matters to your target audience. 4. About You/Your Team
Share your story—who you are, your background, and why you're passionate about web development.
Include any relevant experience or qualifications, and be sure to highlight your expertise in specific areas like responsive design, e-commerce, or custom CMS.
If you’re a solo entrepreneur, showcase your personality to help potential clients connect with you. 5. Testimonials & Reviews
Social proof goes a long way. Add quotes or case studies from satisfied clients. Even if they’re from people you’ve worked with previously or for other projects, testimonials will build trust.
Ideally, make sure these highlight specific results (e.g., increase in website traffic, better user experience, higher conversion rates). 6. Contact Information
Make it super easy for potential clients to reach you. Include an easy-to-find contact page with a form, email, phone number, and even social media links.
Consider adding a call-to-action (CTA) on every page (e.g., “Get a Free Quote,” “Schedule a Consultation,” or “Request a Website Audit”). 7. Clear Pricing (If Possible)
Some people are hesitant to reach out if they have no idea about pricing. If you're comfortable, you could give an estimate range for different types of websites or packages. Even a general price range gives people a sense of whether your services are in line with their budget. 8. Blog (Optional, but Helpful)
Having a blog or knowledge center can position you as an expert in your field. You could write about topics like:
Best practices for web design
SEO tips for websites
Common mistakes to avoid in web development
Web design trends
This will also help with SEO, drawing more organic traffic to your site. 9. Social Proof
Showcase any certifications, partnerships, or technologies you're familiar with (like WordPress, Shopify, or Squarespace).
If you’ve worked with notable clients, add their logos as credibility. 10. Call to Action
Every page should have a call to action that encourages people to get in touch. Whether that’s scheduling a call, requesting a quote, or browsing your portfolio, make it easy for visitors to take the next step.
Design Tips:
Simple and Clean: Your website needs to showcase your design skills, so keep it clean, professional, and user-friendly.
Mobile-Friendly: Ensure the site looks great on mobile devices. Clients will be checking your website from their phones.
Fast Loading Speed: A slow website can deter potential clients. Make sure your site is optimized to load quickly.
How do you want to position your brand—do you want to focus on certain niches or types of businesses, or are you looking for a more general approach?
